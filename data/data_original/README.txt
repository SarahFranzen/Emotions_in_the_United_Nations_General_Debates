Latest version (v12, 30 August 2024) contains updated dataset including Session 78 (2023). 


- The dataset now covers the United Nations General Debate Corpus (UNGDC) for the period 1946-2023.
	"UNGDC_1946-2023.tgz"

- There are 10,760 speeches in plain text format (UTF8). Speeches are structured by Year (Session). Each speech is named using the following convention: ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code, followed by the UN Session number, followed by year. E.g. USA_75_2020.txt.

- The collection also contains a file (Speakers_by_session.xlsx) recording names and posts of speakers in UN General Debates. Note: before 1994 the UN records do not consistently identify the posts of all speakers.

- Original source files contain verbatim daily transcripts of the UN General Debate (and any other business on the UN agenda on the same day). Transcripts (in PDF format) were made available by the UN Library and processed to produce the UNGD Corpus as described in the paper. The original source files (PDFs) are in several tarballs: 
	“Raw_PDFs_1946-1969.tgz”; 
	“Raw_PDFs_1970-1990.tgz”; 
	“Raw_PDFs_1991-2022.tgz”.
